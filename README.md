Gamepad Cam Recorder
-----
This HDA allows you to animate your camera using a gamepad in Houdini. 

- Download the `.hdanc` for Houdini Apprentice or `.otllc` for Houdini Indie, and put it in your `otls` directory (on Windows, that's usually `\Documents\houdinixx.x\otls`).
- Launch Houdini and the HDA should appear in the TAB Menu under the name `Gamepad Cam Recorder`.
